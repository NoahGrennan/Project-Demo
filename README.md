# Project-Demo
#This project is based off using and Arduino and components for that device. My goal is by using an Arduino i can turn on and off lights by clapping.I can also use some code and change it so eveytime I clap I can dim the light from on to off or reverse. 
My next step was to use a servo motor to turn a little light switch on and off by going in one direction and then the other.
Something I could have also done is to get a component that would recognise a voice by recognising the words 'off' or 'on'. This would allow me to turn them off and on without making a loud clapping noise for people at night. Right now, at this stage, I still have an LED that turns off and on, but if I had the right components, I could attach to a breadboard something that can support a real lightbulb that can dim or get brighter or totally off.
