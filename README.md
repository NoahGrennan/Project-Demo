# Project-Demo
#This project is based off using and Arduino and components for that device. My goal is by using an arudino i can turn on and off lights by clapping.I can alaso use some code and change iot so eveytime i clap i can dim the lighht freom on to off or reverse.  My next step is to get a component that would be able reconise a voice by reconisng the words 'off' or 'on' and this would allow me to turn them off and on without making a loud clapping noise for people at night. Right now at this stage I still have an LED that turns off and on but if i had the right componets i could attach to a breaboard something that can support a rel lightbuld that can dim or get brigher or totaly off.
